# FFmpeg Downloader Improvements

## Summary of Changes

The FFmpeg downloader has been significantly enhanced with better reliability, user feedback, and error handling.

## New Features

### 1. **Progress Reporting** 
- Added `ProgressCallback` delegate for real-time download status
- Shows download progress with MB downloaded / total MB
- Updates status during extraction and validation phases
- MainForm now displays live updates in the status bar

### 2. **Automatic Retry Logic**
- Automatically retries failed downloads up to 3 times
- 2-second delay between retry attempts
- Handles transient network errors gracefully
- Prevents single network hiccup from failing entire download

### 3. **Download Validation**
- Validates file size (minimum 50MB) after download
- Prevents corrupted/incomplete downloads from being used
- Checks if downloaded ZIP is valid before extraction
- Better error messages for corrupted downloads

### 4. **Executable Validation**
- Runs `ffmpeg -version` to verify executable works
- Checks file size (minimum 10KB) as basic sanity check
- Prevents using broken or stub executables
- Validates installation before returning success

### 5. **Better Error Handling**
- Specific exception types for different failure modes:
  - `HttpRequestException` - Network errors
  - `InvalidDataException` - Corrupted downloads
  - Generic `Exception` - Other errors
- Detailed error messages with failure causes
- Debug output for troubleshooting
- Graceful failure with null return

### 6. **Enhanced Extraction**
- Extracts ZIP on background thread (doesn't block UI)
- Finds both `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`
- Moves executables to target folder root
- Cleans up nested folders after extraction
- Keeps only essential executables

### 7. **Smart Cleanup**
- Removes temporary ZIP file after extraction
- Deletes nested subdirectories
- Leaves only ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe in target folder
- Ignores cleanup errors (non-critical)

### 8. **Better User Experience**
- Shows status messages during each phase
- "✅ FFmpeg ready!" on success
- "❌ Network error" on failure
- Clear feedback about what's happening
- Progress bar-style updates during download

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Added XML documentation for all public methods
- Used `Debug.WriteLine` instead of `Console.WriteLine`
- Proper async/await patterns throughout
- Better resource management with `using` statements

### Performance
- Streams download directly to file (low memory usage)
- 8KB buffer for efficient file I/O
- Background thread for extraction
- Doesn't block UI thread

### Reliability
- 10-minute timeout for slow connections
- Validates at multiple stages
- Graceful error handling
- Safe cleanup even on errors

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Simple usage (existing behavior)
string? ffmpegPath = await FfmpegDownloader.EnsureFfmpegPresentAsync("C:\\ffmpeg");

// With progress reporting (new)
string? ffmpegPath = await FfmpegDownloader.EnsureFfmpegPresentAsync(
    "C:\\ffmpeg",
    (bytesDownloaded, totalBytes, status) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{status} - {bytesDownloaded}/{totalBytes}");
    });
```

## Benefits

1. **More Reliable** - Retries and validation prevent most failures
2. **Better Feedback** - Users know what's happening at all times
3. **Faster Recovery** - Automatic retries handle transient errors
4. **Cleaner** - Organized file structure, no leftover junk
5. **Safer** - Validates executables before declaring success

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are 100% backward compatible:
- Old code using `EnsureFfmpegPresentAsync(path)` still works
- Progress callback is optional parameter (defaults to null)
- Return type unchanged (still returns `string?`)
- No breaking changes to public API

## Testing Recommendations

Test these scenarios:
1. ✅ Fresh install (no FFmpeg)
2. ✅ FFmpeg already exists (skip download)
3. ✅ Network interruption during download (retry)
4. ✅ Corrupted download (validation fails)
5. ✅ Invalid FFmpeg executable (validation fails)
6. ✅ Slow network (timeout handling)
7. ✅ Disk full during download (error handling)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Consider adding:
- [ ] Cancellation token support
- [ ] Alternative download sources (mirrors)
- [ ] Version checking and updates
- [ ] Progress bar control in UI
- [ ] Download speed indicator
- [ ] Resume interrupted downloads
- [ ] Hash verification (SHA256)
- [ ] Offline installer option

## Files Modified

1. `FfmpegDownloader.cs` - Complete rewrite with improvements
2. `MainForm.cs` - Updated to use progress callback
