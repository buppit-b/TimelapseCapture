# CLAUDE.md — TimelapseCapture

Read this first — it's the single source of truth for working in this repo.
Treat any **specific** claim here (line numbers, signatures, status) as a
hypothesis to confirm against the code before you rely on it. The standing rule
is: **verify, then act.**

---

## What this is

A Windows desktop app that captures screen frames on a timer and encodes them
into timelapse videos via FFmpeg. Built for digital art and long-running, often
unattended capture. Power-user oriented, not hand-holdy.

**The app is mid-migration from WinForms to a WPF rebuild. WPF is the active
front-end.** The two front-ends share one engine:

- **`TimelapseCapture.Wpf`** — the **active** app. WPF + MVVM, clean dark theme,
  terminal/green accent. This is what we develop now.
- **`TimelapseCapture.Core`** — UI-framework-agnostic shared library: capture
  engine, sessions, settings, ffmpeg, system stats. Both front-ends use it.
- **`TimelapseCapture` (root `src/`)** — the **legacy WinForms app**. Still in the
  solution and still builds, kept for reference/parity-checking. Don't invest in
  it; port anything missing into the WPF app instead. (It carries its own private
  copies of the Core classes under `src/Core`, `src/Capture`, etc. — that's why
  the two projects don't collide.)
- **`TimelapseCapture.Tests`** — 12 tests, cover `SessionManager`, `ValidationHelper`,
  and `ScreenHelper` (region-relocate geometry).

- Repo: https://github.com/buppit-b/TimelapseCapture (default branch `main`)
- **Build:** `dotnet build TimelapseCapture.sln`
- **Run the WPF app:** `dotnet run --project TimelapseCapture.Wpf`
  (or launch `TimelapseCapture.Wpf/bin/Debug/net9.0-windows/TimelapseCapture.Wpf.exe`)
- **Test:** `dotnet test TimelapseCapture.sln`
- Windows only (.NET 9, `net9.0-windows`).

## How to work here

Small, single-maintainer app. The working bar:

> **Understand the system you're touching, make a focused change, and verify it
> builds and runs.**

- **Verify before you trust** (including claims in this file).
- **Keep the build green** — `dotnet build` at 0 errors, `dotnet test` at 12/12.
- **Respect the invariants below** — each came from a shipped bug.
- Improving/simplifying nearby code is welcome; for a true architectural shift,
  align on the approach first.
- **Don't add dependencies** without a clear reason — the app is intentionally lean.
- Aesthetics are **deprioritized** right now (Spike's call): clean up what we had,
  green accent is fine as placeholder, function/parity first. A richer aesthetic
  pass comes later.

## Critical invariants (these are real — don't "clean them up")

### 1. Capture-engine threading (`TimelapseCapture.Core/Capture/CaptureEngine.cs`)

- Capture runs on a `System.Threading.Timer` (NOT the UI thread).
- All shared-state access is inside `lock (_lock)`.
- **Events (`FrameCaptured`, `CaptureFailed`, `SmartStatusChanged`) are raised
  OUTSIDE the lock** — a subscriber may call `Stop()` on another thread; raising
  inside the lock would deadlock. Keep it that way.
- **No async/await in the capture path, no fire-and-forget tasks.** Hard constraint.
- The WPF VM marshals these events to the UI thread via
  `Application.Current.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke` (see `MainViewModel.OnFrameCaptured`
  / `OnSmartStatus`). Never touch WPF controls directly from an engine event.

### 2. Region / DPI

- Capture works in **physical pixels**; WPF works in **DIPs**. Convert with
  `ScreenHelper.SystemDpiScale()` (see `RegionOverlay.ShowForRegion`,
  `RegionSelectOverlay`, `RegionEditOverlay`).
- In the WPF VM the runtime region is `_region`. Every region source
  (`SelectRegion`, `SelectFullScreen`, `EditRegion`) funnels through the single
  `ApplyRegion()` method, which updates `_region` + `RegionText` + the overlay AND
  persists the region into `session.json` via `PersistRegion()` (reload-set-save,
  frame-count safe). Loading restores `_region` from `session.CaptureRegion`,
  validated to still intersect a current monitor. **Route any new region source
  through `ApplyRegion()`.** (The engine does NOT persist the region — `ApplyRegion`
  does. An earlier version of this file wrongly said the engine saved it, and the
  region was in fact never persisted, so loading a session always lost it.)
- The on-screen overlay (`RegionOverlay`) draws its 2px outline in the ring
  **just outside** the region (and its dimension label **above** the top edge) so
  the outline is never captured into the frames. Don't move it onto the region.

### 3. Persistence is crash-safe

- `SettingsManager.Save()` and `SessionManager.SaveSession()` write atomically
  (temp file + `File.Replace`) and swallow/log IO errors. An IO hiccup must not
  corrupt `settings.json`/`session.json` or throw into the capture loop.
- Settings fields are **additive** for backward-compat (e.g. `IntervalSecondsExact`,
  `JpegQuality`). Add new settings the same way — never renumber/remove.

### 4. Sessions

- Session files are user data. **Never delete automatically.**
- `FramesCaptured > 0 && CaptureRegion == null` is a known recoverable corruption
  state — use `ValidateAndRepairSession()`, don't hand-roll a fix.
- At most one session has `Active = true`.

### 5. Encoding correctness (`TimelapseCapture.Core/Video/VideoEncoder.cs`)

- Uses the ffmpeg **image2 demuxer** (`-framerate {fps} -start_number 1 -i %05d.ext
  -pix_fmt yuv420p`), NOT the concat demuxer — concat + `-r` resampling dropped
  frames (165 in → tiny output). Verified 165→165. Don't "simplify" back to concat.
- Frames must be **uniform** (same WxH and same extension) for image2 to work.
  That's why the WPF app warns before changing **region** or **format** when a
  session already has frames (`ConfirmRegionChange()` / the `UsePng` setter).
- JPEG quality only applies because the engine saves via a JPEG quality encoder
  (`CaptureEngine.SaveBitmap`) — plain `Bitmap.Save(file, ImageFormat.Jpeg)`
  silently ignores the quality. Don't revert that.

`MainViewModel` is the place to look for almost any WPF behavior. Key shape:
engine events → marshalled to UI; a 1s `DispatcherTimer` drives `RefreshStats()`
(elapsed every tick, the heavier disk probe throttled to ~2s); commands gate on
`IsCapturing` / `NotCapturing` / `RegionNeeded` / `SessionNeeded` etc.

## WPF feature status (verified 2026-06-24)

**Done — at or beyond WinForms parity:**
output folder picker · new/load session · open session folder · select region +
full screen · region overlay toggle (click-through, shows WxH, "Show"→"Hide"
accent when on) · start/stop capture · sub-second interval (`IntervalSecondsExact`,
decimal) · format JPEG/PNG · **working JPEG quality** · smart interval
(active/idle/skip) with **live status** (Active / Idle — slowed / Idle — skipping)
· encode (image2, exact frames) · **cancel encode** (button flips to "Cancel
encode") · ffmpeg download (speed + cancel) / browse / custom-path-override warning
· encode fps + CRF · stats panel (frame size, projected/total/available storage,
memory) · **% progress vs target** + live target field (s/m/h) · **Run + Total
elapsed** (Total accumulates across stop/start and persists across reload via
`SessionInfo.TotalCaptureSeconds`) · lock settings during capture ·
**mid-session change warnings** (region/format with frames) · tooltips
throughout · pulse/highlight cues for the next required action ·
**in-app session picker** (dark list: name · date · frames · size, replaces the
native folder browser) · **encode preset** (Fast/Medium/Slow segmented control) ·
**aspect-ratio lock** on region select (Free/16:9/4:3/1:1/9:16) · **editable region
overlay** ("Edit" → drag to move, 8 handles to resize, Apply/Cancel; corners keep
the locked ratio, edges free, Shift frees) · **live preview** of the latest frame
(bottom-right) · **pulsing red ● REC** header indicator · **rename session** (click
the header name) · **settings cog** (⚙ → SettingsDialog, "always on top" so far).

**Smart interval semantics (corrected — don't re-invert):** the main **Interval**
is the *working/active* rate; when idle, capture slows to **Idle rate**
(`IdleIntervalSeconds`, clamped to never be faster than the working rate) or skips.
Engine: active → `_baseIntervalMs`; idle → `max(base, _idleIntervalMs)` or skip.
The old model (idle used the main interval, "Active (s)" was the active rate) let a
fast main interval capture *more* while idle — that was the bug. `ActiveIntervalSeconds`
remains in settings as dead/legacy (WinForms); WPF uses `IdleIntervalSeconds`.

**WPF binding gotcha:** `<Run Text="{Binding ...}">` defaults to **TwoWay** and
throws on read-only props (crashed the session picker). Bind one `TextBlock.Text`
to a precomputed string instead of multiple `Run`s.

The original parity-plus-polish list is **complete**. Reusable bits added this
session: a dark **segmented control** (`Seg` style + `StringEqualsConverter`, in
`App.xaml`/`Converters.cs`) — prefer it over a ComboBox for any future discrete
pick; and `RegionEditOverlay` for on-screen region editing.

**Needs hands-on verification (built, not screen-tested by Claude):** the
**editable overlay** drag/resize math (handle hit-testing, DPI conversion, multi-
monitor offset) and the **aspect-ratio** constraint visuals. They build and the
logic is straightforward, but interactive drag really wants a human eye — if a
handle feels off or the box jumps, look at `RegionEditOverlay.OnMouseMove`.

**Remaining:** only the deferred **aesthetic pass** (Spike wants it *later* — clean
dark + terminal vibe is in; richer styling is explicitly not now). The
parity-plus-polish work is otherwise complete.

---

## Handoff notes for the next thread

- This session was a long, iterative polish pass on the WPF app driven by Spike
  testing each build and sending screenshots. Everything under "Done" is pushed to
  `main` (latest commit ~`50022b9`).
- The parity-plus-polish list is finished, including the last four items: in-app
  session picker, encode preset, aspect-ratio lock, and the editable region
  overlay. The editable overlay + aspect-ratio constraint still want Spike's
  hands-on test (see "Needs hands-on verification" above).
- **Next:** whatever Spike reports from testing, then optionally the remaining
  ideas above (persist total time, picker thumbnails) and — when he's ready — the
  deferred aesthetic pass.
- **Ignore `C:\Users\Spike\.claude\plans\jazzy-baking-trinket.md`** — it's a plan
  for reworking the *old WinForms* UI and is obsolete (we rebuilt in WPF instead).
- Keep committing per-feature and relaunching the exe for Spike to verify.

## Issue log (newest first)

#### WPF rebuild + full feature port (in progress — 2026-06-24)
- New WPF/MVVM front-end on the shared `TimelapseCapture.Core` engine reached
  WinForms parity plus polish (see feature status). Fixed along the way: encode
  frame-drop (concat→image2), sub-second interval (decimal `IntervalSecondsExact`),
  JPEG quality actually applying (quality encoder in `CaptureEngine.SaveBitmap`),
  ContextMenu dispose race, region-overlay click-through + not-captured outline.

#### (Legacy WinForms history) Full review — 21 findings, all addressed (2026-06-23)
- Pre-rebuild hardening of the WinForms app: crash guards for bad settings/session
  files, a close-time `session.json` race, atomic persistence, ffmpeg validation
  deadlock, leaks, encode Cancel, custom-ffmpeg-path warning. (Applies to `src/`.)

## Where to look for more (only if pointed here)

- `docs/STRUCTURAL_MAP.md`, `docs/PROJECT.md` — describe the **legacy WinForms**
  structure + schemas; useful for parity but not the WPF layout.
- `docs/archive/` — completed features, fixed bugs, superseded docs.
